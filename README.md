# Embedded-Programming

Welcome to my repository, a compilation of my work in the realm of embedded programming. Currently, my focus lies primarily on the use of Espressif devices and their associated frameworks.

In this repository, you will encounter a broad overview of each project. For a more in-depth understanding, including specifics and detailed documentation, please refer to the source code or README file of the corresponding project.

## Project: Light-it-Up

Light-it-Up marks the inception of my journey into embedded programming. It's a comprehensive project that fuses visual feedback through LED indicators with touch sensor interactions, providing an interactive experience.
